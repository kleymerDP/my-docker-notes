- to install Docker, go to the following link
    url : https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

- docker image can be found in the docker registry (dockerHub).
    url : https://hub.docker.com (official).

" Download an imagen in docker.
  >> docker pull <image-name>

" Run an imagen in docker.
  >> docker run <image-name>

  | note : if we use the command 'docker run' with an image that has
  |        not been extracted, 'docker run' will call 'docker pull'.

" Download an image with a tag (differentiate between different
  versions of an image or software).
  >> docker pull <image-name>:tag

  | note : if no 'tag' is specified, it will automatically download
  |        'latest' (default).


▌ NOTE : First we must clarify that the images are a set of layers.
▌       
▌        If we want to download the same image but specifying the
▌        'tag' and between them they share some layers, docker will
▌        only download the difference between them (it does not
▌        redownload what is already downloaded being super efficient
▌        with the space issue).
